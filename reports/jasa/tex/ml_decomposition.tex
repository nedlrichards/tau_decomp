\section{\label{sec:intro} Introduction}

The paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:decompostion} discusses the dynamic decompostion of the observed sound speed field into spice and tilt structures.

\section{North Pacific transcet}
This study is based on a 970 km SeaSoar conductivity, salinity and depth (CTD) transect taken over 4 days in the North Pacific\citep{cole2010seasonal}, Fig. \ref{fig:transcet}. The 970 km long transcet is largely parrellel to the $16 \ ^\circ$C isotherm, computed using the 50 m depth bin of the World Ocean Atlas spring decadal average. Small differences in slope between the track and the isotherm predict a slight warming of the mixed layer over the transcet. Strong and coherent salinity fronts are expected to be a perminant feature in the region.

The SeaSoar observation used in this study (described as Section 3 in Colosi and Rudnick \citep{colosi2020observations}) extended from the sea surface to 430 m depth, with an average cycle length of 1.28 km. The SeaSoar observations were gridded to a 1 km horizontal and 0.5 m vertical resolution for this study. Sound speed, $c$, computed from the CTD data using the Thermodynamic Equation of SeaWater 2010 (TEOS-10), is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:c_grid}. The mixed layer is apparent as relatively high sound speed over a strong negative sound speed gradient that extends into the deep ocean. Horizontal and vertical differences in sound speed are apparent throughout the mixed layer observations \citep{colosi2020observations}, caused by internal waves, fronts, eddies and ocean spice. Ocean spice, or density compensated salinity and temperature variation, can be separated from ocean processes like internal waves that cause displacement of denisty surfaces\citep{dzieciuch2004}. This study will first separate the sound speed variation associated with isopycnal tilt from density compensated variation, and then quanitify the effects of these components on acoustic propagation.

The nominal model of the mixed layer is wind induced mixing at the air-sea interface homogenizes the vertical properties and leads to an unstratified layer. An example of a homogenized mixed layer profile was measured at 252 km, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles}. Although marginal stratification is required for dynamic stability, the potential density, $\sigma$, of the mixed layer is essentially constant. The spice profile, $\gamma$, quantifies density compensated changes in ocean properties and is also essentially constant. The sound speed is dominated by the adiabatic pressure gradient, roughly 0.16 (m/s) / m. The downward sound speed gradient creates an upward diffracting duct bounded on the top by the free surface, modeled as a perfect reflector.

\end{figure}

The sonic layer depth (SLD), the depth of maximum $c$ above the thermocline, is the only free variable for vertically homogeneous mixed layer. The SLD is shown as a black line in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles}, and SLD observations vary between 132 m and 32.5 m. Increases in the SLD increase the viability of the mixed layer acoustic duct. One metric of this viability is the mode cutoff frequency,
\begin{equation}
    f_{min}(n) = \frac{3(4n-1)}{16} \sqrt{\frac{c_0^3}{2h^3} \left( \frac{\partial c}{\partial z} \right) ^ {-1}},
    \label{eq:f_cutoff}
\end{equation}
which has units of Hz. A constant value of $c_0 = 1500$ m/s is assumed. With an adiabatic gradient of 0.16 (m/s) / m, the cutoff frequency for mode number $n$ is determined by the mixed layer depth. The cuttoff frequencies for this simple model and the observed SLD range between roughly 40 and 200 Hz, which are significantly lower than the acoustic frequencies (400 and 1000 Hz) used in this study. Changes in the SLD often predict changes in the viability of the acoustic duct, although acoustic transmission modelling discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:propagation} indicates the significant differences in cutoff frequencies for the observed mixed layer duct.

Over the entire transcet, the SLD increases with range, and a linear regression fit begins at 78.5 m and has a slope of 2 m / 100 km. While the large scale trend of increasing SLD indicates the mixed layer duct is strengthening, significant variability is also observed in SLD depth over the entire transect. The SLD is also shown as horizontal grey lines in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles}. The rapid variation in 3 km between the profiles at 249 and 252 km is one such example that indicates fine scale range dependence of the mixed layer is acoustically significant.

The transect and the 249 km profile in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles} show the mixed layer sometimes has significant vertical sound speed structure. This structure can arise from from ocean processes that tilt stratification contours in the upper mixed layer, like eddies and internal waves. Alternatively, vertical structure in sound speed can arise from density compensated salinity and temperature variation, or spice. The profile The local spice, $\gamma$, is used as a measure of the density compensated variation \citep{klymak2015spice},
\begin{equation}
    \gamma=\textrm{sgn}(T-\bar{T}) \sqrt{\alpha_0^2(T-\bar{T})^2 +\beta_0^2(S-\bar{S})^2},
    \label{eq:gamma}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{T}$ and $\bar{S}$ are the means of temperature and salinity at constant density, and a representative ($\bar{T}$, $\bar{S}$) value defines $\alpha_0=\partial \sigma / \partial T$ and $\beta_0=\partial \sigma / \partial S$. $\gamma$ is potential variable that represents linearized distance in density units along (T, S) isopycnals. Density compensation occurs when salinity and temperature increase or decrease proportionally, these changes in both variables are reinforcing in sound speed. The effect of spice is a dominant factor above the thermocline in the sound speed profile at 249 km in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles}, while tilt processes are responsible for the approximatly 5 m change in thermocline depth between the two profiles.

The density at 40 m depth decreases with range, with a linear regression intercept at $\sigma=25.3$ kg/m$^3$ and a slope of -0.04 (kg/m$^3$) / 100 km. The decrease in density means that as range increases, mixed layer isopycnals transition to positions with stable stratification below the mixed layer.

\section{\label{sec:decomposition}Spice and tilt decompostion}
A dynamic decomposition is used to separated the observed sound speed variations into contributions from: (1) isopycnal tilt and (2) density compensated sound speed variation proportional to ocean spice. This decomposition follows the method proposed for a similar SeaSoar transect by Dzieciuch \emph{et al.}\citep{dzieciuch2004}, although spice in the mixed layer is treated differently here. The decomposition is first described for the case for a stratified region, which is applied below the mixed layer. A modified treatment of spice in the marginally stratified mixed layer is discussed next. Finally, the decomposed sound speed fields are compared.

The lowpass estimate of the $\sigma=25.31$ (kg/m$^3$) is shown in (b), to represent common processing of all isopycnals. The full record shows isopycnals shoal and enter the mixed layer with decreasing range. The stable isopycnal estimate ends at the first location the isopycnal enters the mixed layer. Intermittent outcropping of the isopycnal are apparent as gaps in the $\sigma=25.21$ (kg/m$^3$) isopycnal position. The spice record has been imputed at the isopycnal outcroppings to form a continuous series.}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Stratified ocean decomposition}
The dynamic decomposition begins by defining a gridded quantity, $\sigma$ is used for demonstration, by interpolation of values along isopycnals. This definition allows for the generation of new fields that differs from the observed field only in isopycnal positions. The isopycnal positions are thenn flattened to approximatly removal dynamic isopycnal tilt. The isopycnal positions are defined as $\sigma(x, z) = z^{-1}(x, \sigma)$, which is discretized as $z_i(x; \sigma_i)$. A two dimensional linear interpolation is defined for $\sigma$,
\begin{equation}
    \sigma\approx\mathcal{L}(x, y; \sigma_i, z_i).
    \label{eq:lin_intr}
\end{equation}
The positions $z_i(x, \sigma)$ modeled as the superposition of fine scale dynamics on a stable background position $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$. The background density field, $\bar{\sigma}$, is defined by substituting $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$ for $z(x, \sigma)$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:lin_intr}. The estimate of $\bar{\sigma}$ is then a vertically stretched version of the observed $\sigma$ field without fine scale tilt dynamics.

The background isopycnal position is estimated with a spatial lowpass filter. This study uses a cutoff of 50 km for the estimate of $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$, which is shown as red lines in Fig. \ref{fig:cntrs}(a). The estimated position where the isopycnal moves into the mixed layer is used as the start of the $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$ estimate, apparent around 250 km for $\sigma=25.25$ (kg/m$^3$). A conservative estimate is made for the start position of $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$ is made where the position of the isopycnal becomes decorrelated with the next denser isopycnal. Isopycnals inside the mixed layer are considered unstable and no attempt is made to estimate a background isopycnal position.

The same stable isopycnal positions can also define estimates of other field quantities without fine scale isopycnal tilt. While sound speed is ultimately the field quantity of interest, the variable of ocean spice is used here instead,
\begin{equation}
    \gamma\approx\mathcal{L}(x, z; \gamma_i(x), z_i),
    \label{eq:lin_intr_gamma}
\end{equation}
where the range dependent $\gamma_i(x)$ is measured along the $\sigma_i$ isopycnal. The accuracy of Eq. \eqref{eq:lin_intr_gamma} depends on the changes in ocean stratification between the isopycnal positions, $z_i$, and has the smallest error in well stratified regions.

The $\gamma$ field in Eq. \eqref{eq:lin_intr_gamma} allows for the additional definition of a stable background value along isopycnals, $\hat{\gamma}_i(x)$. This leads to four possible $\gamma$ fields with the combination of parameter pairs: the stable background field, ($\bar{\gamma}_i$, $\bar{z}_i$); the tilt field, ($\bar{gamma_i}$, $z_i$); the spice field, ($gamma_i$, $\bar{z}_i$); and the observed total field, ($gamma_i$, $z_i$).

The sound speed can be computed from ($\sigma$, $\gamma$) through an inverse of Eq. \eqref{eq:gamma}. The inverse function is computed by iteration. The values of $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ from Eq. \eqref{eq:gamma} define the angle $\phi_0$, a linearized estimate of the angle in ($\theta$, S) space of maximum $d\gamma$ and zero $d\sigma$. The value of ($\sigma$, $\gamma$) is first estimated from $\theta_0$. Then, the value of $\sigma$ is refined with the local value of $\theta$, and finally gamma is corrected with $\theta_0$. This process can be repeated to a desired precision of ($\theta$, S), which are combined with the isopycnal position to compute a value of sound speed.


\subsection{Mixed layer decomposition}
Estimation of the stable isopycnal position and spice with a lowpass filter is most effective outside of the mixed layer where the ocean is well stratified in regions of significant spice variation. Two challenges in the dynamic decomposition of \citep{dzieciuch2004} arise in the mixed layer: (1) significant variations of $\gamma$ occur in positions with small $\sigma$ gradients, and (2) isopycnal locations vary rapidly and may not have a stable position. Both challenges are related to the constraint of sampling the spice field at isopycnal positions imposed by the decomposition method. A linear superposition model for $\gamma$ is used in the mixed layer to avoid the requirement of sampling along isopycnals.

The linear superposition model for $\gamma$ attributes all observed $\gamma$ variability that is not explained by the tilt field to the spice field, without any vertical streching to account for the mean isopycnal levels. The linear superposition model is written
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{observed} = \tau_{bg} + \Delta \tau_{tilt} + \Delta \tau_{spice},
\end{equation}
with the spice field is defined as $\tau_{bg} + \Delta \tau_{spice}$, and similarly for tilt. The value of $\Delta \tau_{spice}$ is be estimated by subtracting $\tau_{tilt}$ from $\tau_{observed}$.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/rms_profile.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:c_rms}{The mean sound speed profile and the RMS profile of the deviation from the background field of the measured, tilt and spice fields. }}
\end{figure}

Internal waves largely followed the Garret-Munk spectrum up to the mixed layer, while eddies and fronts were the largest contribution to tilt in the mixed layer.

\section{\label{sec:propagation}Mixed layer acoustic propagation}
Acoustic propagation simulations are used to predict the effect of the separated tilt and spice sound speed structures on acoustic propagation in the mixed layer duct, with a focus on a single convergence zone length, Fig. \ref{fig:decomp_xmission}. A few kilometers from the source the acoustic energy in the mixed layer duct propagation is dominated by a few modes up to the first convergence zone. Outside of the source region acoustic energy in the mixed layer is monotonically decreasing.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/decomp_xmission.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:decomp_x}{Left panels is sound speed field, right panel is acoustic pressure. The rows are the (a) tilt, (b) spice and (c) total fields.}}
\end{figure}

Since mixed layer propagation is largely vertically uniform, the integrated mixed layer energy is used as a primary quantification of the duct.
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Loss}_{\textrm{ML}} = -10 \, \textrm{log}_{10} \left( \frac{1}{D} \int^{D}_0 p p^* \,  dz \right)
\end{equation}
An fixed integration depth, $D=$120 m, is sufficient since energy does not persist in the strong downward refracting region below the mixed layer.

\subsection{Background field prorogation}
The background field is very similar to the range independent field predicted by the mean sound speed profile.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/mode_shapes.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:bg_modes}{Shapes of the three mode closest to the longest loop length pair.}}
\end{figure}

Since the only significant boundry interaction was the pressre release at $z=0$, normal modes were calculated using a tridiagonal eigenvalue decompostion. The modes with significant mixed layer interaction were identified by long loop lengths,
\begin{equation}
    l_{mn} = \frac{2 \pi}{k_n - k_m}.
    \label{eq:loop_length}
\end{equation}
The longest loop lengths were observed for mixed layer mode 1, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bg_modes}.

The multiple mixed layer modes with the same number of zero crossings in the mixed layer interfere and cause acoustic leakage out of the mixed layer.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/bg_eng_loss.png}
    \caption{Acoustic energy in the background mixed layer for a 400 Hz source at 400 m depth. Significantly more loss is observed at ranges less than 300 km, shown as yellow lines. The loss is shown as thick black line, and mean plus and minus the RMS estimate are thin black lines. The 10th and 90th percentile estimates are dashed blue lines. The difference in agreement between the two percentiles and the RMS indicate a relativly small number of high loss events significantly impact the variance estimate.}
    \label{fig:bg_eng}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Mixed layer blocking features}
The mixed layer duct simulations is dominated by local features and propagation that is effected similarly over the entire propagation range. The most significant local features observed cause significant loss in the mixed layer duct, and are called blocking features. These are defined as regions where the acoustic energy falls by 3 dB over less than 5 km, relative to the background field. Blocking features are much more significant at 400 Hz than 1 kHz.

\subsection{Propagation without blocking features}

For regions without blocking features, the range dependence of the sound speed field can slowly change the acoustic energy significantly, sometimes accumulating the total effect of a blocking feature. The range dependence can also act to delay diffraction loss from the channel.

The acoustic energy in the mixed layer at low frequencies is significantly affected by diffraction, which is apparent in range independent simulations. In this study, the background field is used to compute the diffraction effect in a slowly range dependent environment.
