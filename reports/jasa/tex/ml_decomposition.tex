\section{\label{sec:intro} Introduction}

The paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:decompostion} discusses the dynamic decompostion of the observed sound speed field into spice and tilt structures.

\section{North Pacific transcet}
This study is based on a 970 km SeaSoar conductivity, salinity and depth (CTD) transect taken over 4 days in the North Pacific\citep{cole2010seasonal}, Fig. \ref{fig:transcet}. The 970 km long transcet is largely parrellel to the $16 \ ^\circ$C isotherm computed at 50 m depth from the World Ocean Atlas spring decadal average. Small differences in slope between the track and the isotherm predict a slight warming of the mixed layer over the transcet. Strong and coherent salinity fronts are expected to be a perminant feature in the region.

\end{figure}

The SeaSoar observation used in this study (described in detail by Colosi and Rudnick \citep{colosi2020observations}) extended from the sea surface to 430 m depth, with an average cycle length of 1.28 km. The SeaSoar observations were gridded to a 1 km horizontal and 0.5 m vertical resolution for this study. Sound speed, $c$, computed from the CTD data using the Thermodynamic Equation of SeaWater 2010 (TEOS-10), is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:c_grid}. The mixed layer is apparent as relatively high sound speed over a strong negative sound speed gradient that extends into the deep ocean. Horizontal and vertical differences variability of sound speed is apparent throughout the mixed layer observations \citep{colosi2020observations}, caused by internal waves, fronts, eddies and ocean spice. Ocean spice, or density compensated salinity and temperature variation, can be separated in this observation from ocean processes like internal waves that cause displacement of denisty surfaces\citep{dzieciuch2004}. This study will first separate the sound speed variation associated with isopycnal tilt from density compensated variation, and then quanitify the independent effects of these components on acoustic propagation.

\end{figure}

The nominal model of the mixed layer is wind induced mixing at the air-sea interface homogenizes the vertical properties and leads to an unstratified layer. An example of a homogenized mixed layer profile was measured at 252 km, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles}. Although marginal stratification is required for dynamic stability, the potential density, $\sigma$, of the mixed layer is essentially constant. The spice profile, $\gamma$, quantifies density compensated changes in ocean properties and is also essentially constant. The sound speed is dominated by the adiabatic pressure gradient, roughly 0.16 (m/s) / m. The downward sound speed gradient creates an upward diffracting duct bounded on the top by the free surface, modeled as a perfect reflector.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{\label{fig:profiles}{(a) Potential density (b) spiciness and (c) sound speed measured at 249 km (blue curves) and 252 km (orange curves).}}
\end{figure}

The sonic layer depth (SLD), the depth of maximum $c$ above the thermocline, is the only free variable for vertically homogeneous mixed layer. The SLD is shown as a black line in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles}, and SLD observations vary between 132 m and 32.5 m. Increases in the SLD increase the viability of the mixed layer acoustic duct. One metric of this viability is the mode cutoff frequency,
\begin{equation}
    f_{min}(n) = \frac{3(4n-1)}{16} \sqrt{\frac{c_0^3}{2h^3} \left( \frac{\partial c}{\partial z} \right) ^ {-1}},
    \label{eq:f_cutoff}
\end{equation}
which has units of Hz. A constant value of $c_0 = 1500$ m/s is assumed. With an adiabatic gradient of 0.16 (m/s)/m, the cutoff frequency for mode number $n$ is determined by the mixed layer depth. The cuttoff frequencies for this simple model and the observed SLD range between roughly 40 and 200 Hz, which are significantly lower than the acoustic frequencies (400 and 1000 Hz) used in this study. Changes in the SLD often predict changes in the viability of the acoustic duct, although acoustic transmission modelling discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:propagation} indicates significant differences in cutoff frequencies for the observed mixed layer duct.

Over the entire transcet, the SLD increases with range, a linear regression fit has a 78.5 m interscept and a slope of 2 m / 100 km. While the large scale trend of increasing SLD indicates the mixed layer duct is strengthening, significant variability is also observed in SLD depth over the entire transect. The SLD is also shown as horizontal grey lines in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles}. The rapid variation in 3 km between the profiles at 249 and 252 km is one such example that indicates fine scale range dependence of the mixed layer is acoustically significant.

The transect and the 249 km profile in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles} show the mixed layer sometimes has significant vertical sound speed structure. This structure can arise from from ocean processes that tilt stratification contours in the upper mixed layer, like eddies and internal waves. Alternatively, vertical structure in sound speed can arise from density compensated salinity and temperature variation, or spice. The profile of local spice, $\gamma$, is used as a measure of the density compensated variation \citep{klymak2015spice},
\begin{equation}
    \gamma=\textrm{sgn}(T-\bar{T}) \sqrt{\alpha_0^2(T-\bar{T})^2 +\beta_0^2(S-\bar{S})^2},
    \label{eq:gamma}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{T}$ and $\bar{S}$ are the means of temperature and salinity at constant density, and a representative ($\bar{T}$, $\bar{S}$) value defines $\alpha_0=\partial \sigma / \partial T$ and $\beta_0=\partial \sigma / \partial S$. The potential variable $\gamma$ represents linearized distance in density units along (T, S) isopycnals. Density compensation occurs when salinity and temperature increase or decrease change with angle $\alpha$ in the (T, S) diagram, these changes in both variables are reinforcing in sound speed. The effect of spice is a dominant factor above the thermocline in the sound speed profile at 249 km in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles}, while tilt processes are responsible for the approximatly 5 m change in thermocline depth between the two profiles.

The density at 40 m depth decreases with range, with a linear regression intercept at $\sigma=25.3$ kg/m$^3$ and a slope of -0.04 (kg/m$^3$) / 100 km. The decrease in density means that as range increases, mixed layer isopycnals transition to positions with stable stratification below the mixed layer.

\section{\label{sec:decomposition}Spice and tilt decompostion}
A dynamic decomposition is used to separated the observed sound speed variations into contributions from: (1) isopycnal tilt and (2) sound speed variation from ocean spice. This decomposition largely follows the method proposed for a similar SeaSoar transect by Dzieciuch \emph{et al.}\citep{dzieciuch2004}, although spice in the mixed layer is treated differently here. The decomposition is first described for the case for the stratified region below the mixed layer. A linear superpostion model for spice is then proposed for the marginally stratified mixed layer, and the results of the two methods are compared.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/sig_tau_interp.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:cntrs}{Contours of: (a) potential density (b) spice. The lowpass estimate of each stable isopycnal position is shown in (a) as red curve. The lowpass estimate of the $\sigma=25.31$ (kg/m$^3$) is shown in (b) as a red curve, indicative of common isopycnal processing. The full record shows isopycnals shoal and enter the mixed layer with decreasing range. The stable isopycnal estimate ends at the first location the isopycnal displayed significant decorrelation with the lower isopycnal. Intermittent outcropping of the isopycnal are apparent throughout the record, \emph{i.e.} the gaps in (a) of the $\sigma=25.21$ (kg/m$^3$) isopycnal. The spice record has been imputed at the isopycnal outcroppings to form a continuous series.}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Stratified ocean decomposition}
The dynamic decomposition begins by defining a gridded quantity, $\sigma$ is used for demonstration, by interpolation of values along isopycnals. This definition allows for the generation of new fields that differs from the observed field only in isopycnal positions. The isopycnal positions are then flattened to approximate the removal of small scale isopycnal tilt. The isopycnal positions are defined $\sigma(x, z) = z^{-1}(x, \sigma)$, discretized as $z_i(x; \sigma_i)$. A two dimensional linear interpolation is defined for $\sigma$,
\begin{equation}
    \sigma\approx\mathcal{L}(x, y; \sigma_i, z_i).
    \label{eq:lin_intr}
\end{equation}
The positions $z_i(x, \sigma)$ modeled as the superposition of fine scale dynamics on a stable background position $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$. The background density field, $\bar{\sigma}$, is defined by substituting $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$ for $z(x, \sigma)$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:lin_intr}. The estimate of $\bar{\sigma}$ is then a vertically stretched version of the observed $\sigma$ field without fine scale tilt dynamics.

The background isopycnal position is estimated with a spatial lowpass filter. This study uses a cutoff of 50 km, an approximate distance of one convergence zone. The estimate of $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$ is shown as red lines in Fig. \ref{fig:cntrs}(a). Isopycnals inside the mixed layer are observed have unstable positions, and no attempt is made to estimate a background isopycnal position. An estimate for the position where each isopycnal moves to stable stratification below the mixed layer is used to start the $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$ estimate, around 250 km for $\sigma=25.25$ (kg/m$^3$). A conservative estimate is made for the start position of $\bar{z}(x, \sigma)$ where the position of the isopycnal becomes decorrelated with the next denser isopycnal.

The same stable isopycnal positions can also define estimates of other field quantities without fine scale isopycnal tilt. While sound speed is ultimately the field quantity of interest, the variable of ocean spice is used here instead,
\begin{equation}
    \gamma\approx\mathcal{L}(x, z; \gamma_i(x), z_i),
    \label{eq:lin_intr_gamma}
\end{equation}
where the range dependent $\gamma_i(x)$ is measured along the $\sigma_i$ isopycnal. The accuracy of Eq. \eqref{eq:lin_intr_gamma} depends on the changes in ocean stratification between the isopycnal positions, $z_i$, and has the smallest error in well stratified regions.

The $\gamma$ field in Eq. \eqref{eq:lin_intr_gamma} allows for the additional definition of a stable background value along isopycnals, $\hat{\gamma}_i(x)$. This leads to four possible $\gamma$ fields with the combination of parameter pairs: the stable background field, ($\bar{\gamma}_i$, $\bar{z}_i$); the tilt field, ($\bar{gamma_i}$, $z_i$); the spice field, ($gamma_i$, $\bar{z}_i$); and the observed total field, ($gamma_i$, $z_i$).

The sound speed is then computed from ($\sigma$, $\gamma$) through an inverse of Eq. \eqref{eq:gamma} computed by iteration. The values of $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ from Eq. \eqref{eq:gamma} define the angle $\phi_0$, a linearized estimate of the angle in ($\theta$, S) space of maximum $d\gamma$ and zero $d\sigma$. The value of ($\sigma$, $\gamma$) is first estimated from $\theta_0$. Then, the value of $\sigma$ is refined with the local value of $\theta$, and finally gamma is corrected with $\theta_0$. This process can be repeated to a desired precision of ($\theta$, S), which are combined with the isopycnal position to compute a value of sound speed.

\subsection{Mixed layer decomposition}
Estimation of the stable isopycnal position and spice with a lowpass filter is most effective outside of the mixed layer where the ocean is well stratified in regions of significant spice variation. Two challenges in the dynamic decomposition of \citep{dzieciuch2004} arise in the mixed layer: (1) significant variations of $\gamma$ occur in positions with small $\sigma$ gradients, and (2) isopycnal locations vary rapidly and may not have a stable position. Both challenges are related to the constraint of sampling the spice field at isopycnal positions imposed by the decomposition method. A linear superposition model for $\gamma$ is used in the mixed layer to avoid the requirement of sampling along isopycnals.

The linear superposition model for $\gamma$ attributes all observed $\gamma$ variability that is not explained by the tilt field to the spice field, without any vertical streching to account for the mean isopycnal levels. The linear superposition model is written
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{observed} = \tau_{bg} + \Delta \tau_{tilt} + \Delta \tau_{spice},
\end{equation}
with the spice field is defined as $\tau_{bg} + \Delta \tau_{spice}$, and similarly for tilt. The value of $\Delta \tau_{spice}$ is be estimated by subtracting $\tau_{tilt}$ from $\tau_{observed}$.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/rms_profile.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:c_rms}{The mean sound speed profile and the RMS profile of the deviation from the background field of the measured, tilt and spice fields. }}
\end{figure}

Internal waves largely followed the Garret-Munk spectrum up to the mixed layer, while eddies and fronts were the largest contribution to tilt in the mixed layer.

\section{\label{sec:propagation}Mixed layer acoustic propagation}
Acoustic propagation in the mixed layer duct for the separated background, tilt and spice sound speed fields are computed with numerical models. The parabolic equation (PE) is used for transmission loss prediction and mixed layer energy calculations. Normal modes are used to describe the background mixed layer duct and analylize the vertical distribution of the acoustic energy in the mixed layer duct.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/decomp_xmission.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:decomp_x}{Left panels is sound speed field, right panel is acoustic pressure. The rows are the (a) background (b) tilt, (c) spice and (d) total fields. The region up to about 7.5 km from the source has significant downgoing energy for all fields. The convergence zone is apparent as significant energy loops reflecting from the surface about 50 km from the source 50 km from the source. Acoustic loss from sound speed range dependence is apparent between these positions as downgoing energy below the approxiatly 120 m deep duct. The acoustic loss from range dependence is strongest around 250 and 260 km for the spice and total fields, while smaller loss is also observed in the tilt and total fields around 240 km.}}
\end{figure}

Acoustic frequencies are 400 and 1000 Hz. The majority of the analysis focuses on an acoustic source at 40 m depth, over a single convergence zone length.

A representative propagation simulation with a source at 230 km distance along the transcet and 40 m depth is shown in Fig \ref{fig:decomp_x}. The background, tilt, spice and observed sound speed fields are shown in the left column, and PE results on right. The background field is charactoristic of all simulated ranges. The mixed layer duct is obscured by high angle convergence zone propagation in the source region up to about 7.5 km, and in the first convergence zone starting around 47 km. A highly absorbant layer introduced at the bottom of the PE domain surpresses bottom bounce interactions that would otherwise contribute unducted energy to the mixed layer at ranges between 7.5 and 47 km. Without bottom bounce arrivals, the acoustic pressure in the mixed layer duct has a MLM1 vertical distribution with a smooth decrease in magnitude with range. The dynamic fields, in contrast, show significantly range variation. The most range dependence in observed in the spice and total fields, which causes both energy loss and changes in vertical pressure distribution.

The dynamic decomposition into the tilt and spice field emphasize different features in the observed transcet. The mixed layer depth variation is almost exclusivly patritioned into the tilt field. A shoaling of the mixed layer at transcet ranges up to 240 km leads to mixed layer energy loss in the tilt field, which is partially observed in the measured field around 240 km. Also, a surface concentration of lower sound speed appears in the tilt and measured field around 270 to 280 km transcet range. This increases the mean sound speed gradient of the mixed layer, and both strenthens the mixed layer duct and moves acoustic energy to shallower depths. Finally, a strong vertical salinity feature between 250 and 260 km transcet range is partitioned to the spice field. Loss of acoustic energy from the mixed layer duct is concentrated around the edges of this feature, which also significantly changes the vertical pressure sructure from a mode 1 shape.

Significant acoustic energy loss from the mixed layer duct over ranges less than 5 km, like the losses observed at 250 and 260 km transect range, can significantly reduce the viablity of the duct. The term "blocking feature" is used here to describe postions with significant mixed layer energy loss over short ranges. Transmission ranges that include these features will be treated separately, both to quantify the frequency at which these features appear in the dynamic fields, and to isolate these effects from the significantly smaller acoustic variations predicted for much of the transcet.

The viabilty of the mixed layer duct is analyzed over the complete transcet with vertical integrations of acoustic energy.

\subsection{Background field normal modes}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/mode_shapes.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:bg_modes}{(a) Mean sound speed profile of the background field, (b) Shapes of mixed layer mode 1 and sorounding modes at 400 Hz. A significant tail for all mode entend through the mixed layer to the compensation depth of the mixed layer for all modes, and multiple mode shapes exist with no zero crossings in the mixed layer.}}
\end{figure}

Three normal modes of the range averaged background field from 230 to 290 km are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bg_modes}. These modes are centered around mixed layer mode 1 (MLM1), defined here as the mode with the most energy in the mixed layer within a few mode numbers of the first peak in mode loop length. The mode loop length is defined
\begin{equation}
    l_{mn} = \frac{2 \pi}{k_n - k_m},
    \label{eq:loop_length}
\end{equation}
where the mode number $n=m+1$. The typical loop length values of the modes near MLM1 are esentially constant define the convergence length of approximatly 55 km. The mixed layer duct modes have anomalously high loop length values, which can also be used to identify mixed layer mode 2 and higher. The MLM2 is separated from MLM1 by tens of mode numbers, indicating that mode coupling between mixed layer modes spans a range of non-ducted modes and is associated with loss of acoustic energy from the mixed layer.

The mode shape of MLM1 is not orthogonal to the mode shape of MLM1 + 1 over the vertical span of the mixed layer, but orthogonality instead requires integration over the water column to the mixed layer compensation depth around 3200 m. The coherent sum of these modes reenforce or deminish the amplitude of MLM1 with marginal changes to the vertical distribution of the mixed layer pressure field. The interaction between modes leads to a very long range cycling of energy first out from and then back into the mixed layer. This energy cycling is most significant for acoustic frequencies close to the mode 1 cutoff, Eq. \eqref{eq:f_cutoff}. This cycle of energy can act as significan loss of mixed layer energy with mode 1 shape for transmission ranges up to a convergence zone, even in the range independent case when MLM1 amplitude is constant.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/bg_eng_loss.png}
    \caption{Acoustic energy in the background mixed layer for a 400 Hz source at 40 m depth. Significantly more loss is observed at ranges less than 300 km, shown as yellow lines. The mean loss is shown as thick black line, and the mean plus or minus the RMS estimate are thin black lines. The 10th and 90th percentile estimates are dashed blue lines. The difference in agreement between the two percentiles and the RMS indicate a relativly small number of high loss events significantly impact the variance estimate.}
    \label{fig:bg_eng}
\end{figure}

The significant tail below the SLD for MLM1 and higher mixed layer modes make a vertical integration of the mixed layer pressure field the simplest measure of ducted energy. For a mixed layer depth, $D$, this energy is
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Loss}_{\textrm{ML}} = -10 \, \textrm{log}_{10} \left( \frac{1}{D} \int^{D}_0 p p^* \,  dz \right).
\end{equation}
Since acoustic pressure is strongly downward refracted below the mixed layer, this energy calculation it not sensitive to the vertical boundries of integration integration. A fixed integration depth, $D=$150 m, is choosen to be significantly beneath the SLD for all observations.

The energy loss from the mixed layer duct before one convergence zone is show in Fig. \ref{fig:bg_eng} for a 400 Hz source at 40 m depth. A few kilometers from the source the acoustic energy in the mixed layer duct propagation is dominated by a few modes up to the first convergence zone. Outside of the source region acoustic energy in the mixed layer is monotonically decreasing. There is significantly more energy loss at transcet ranges less than 300 km.

Modal estimates of mixed layer energy are also used to describe the vertical distribution of energy. These methods are also capable of distinguishing between ducted and non-ducted energy, although the simulation enviornment used here makes this unnecassary. The modal distribution of energy is described by the mode shapes, for example the MLM1 shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bg_modes}. Both a naive analysis of MLM1 magnitude and a projection of the mixed layer energy onto MLM1 are considered here. The amplitude of MLM1 can be computed directly with coupled mode theory or from projection of the PE result. The Doizier-Trappert coupled mode approximation is used to avoid the projection calculation from the PE result for the approximatly 3200 m long MLM1 shape.

A mode projection method is also considered that only projects MLM1 onto the pressure field up to the first zero crossing. While obscuring some of the essential mixed layer propagation physics, this projection method can produce results closer to the intuative modal description of energy. For a MLM1 with a first zero crossing at depth $D$, this projected energy is calculated
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{D} \int^{D}_0 p \phi_{MLM1} \,  dz.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mixed layer blocking features}\label{sec:blocking}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{../figures/integrated_loss.png}
    \caption{Maximum loss of mixed layer duct energy over 5 km, normalized by background loss. The acoustic energy is simulated for a 400 Hz and 40 m deep source every 10 km. Only the roughly 50 km away from the source and first convergence zone is considered in this calculation. Position independent blocking features have similar maximum loss over this entire span.}
    \label{fig:bg_eng}
\end{figure}

The mixed layer duct simulations show the mixed layer propagation some source  local features and propagation that is effected similarly over the entire propagation range. The most significant local features observed cause significant loss in the mixed layer duct, and are called blocking features. These are defined as regions where the acoustic energy falls by 3 dB over less than 5 km, relative to the background field. Blocking features are much more significant at 400 Hz than 1 kHz.

\subsection{Propagation without blocking features}
For regions without blocking features, the range dependence of the sound speed field can slowly change the acoustic energy significantly, sometimes accumulating the total effect of a blocking feature. The range dependence can also act to delay diffraction loss from the channel.

The acoustic energy in the mixed layer at low frequencies is significantly affected by diffraction, which is apparent in range independent simulations. In this study, the background field is used to compute the diffraction effect in a slowly range dependent environment.
